          <p class="blog-post-meta">1978</p>
          <p>Bench is the Philippines’ leading clothing and lifestyle brand. Its story dates back to 1987, when founder and chief innovator Ben Chan got the opportunity to design and sell men’s T-shirts and jeans at a local department store. Thirty years later, with shops in San Francisco, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Bahrain, Myanmar, Japan, and various cities in China, Bench is now providing affordable and quality products not only to Filipinos, but also to fashion lovers from different corners of the world.</p>
          <p> Today, Bench is recognised as a retail powerhouse and as a consistent provider of fun and functional casualwear, as well as other youthful, practical and trend-purveying products. For its celebrated apparel line, Bench considers comfort and reliability as its utmost priority. From graphic tees to plain T-shirts, tank tops to trousers, jackets to denim jeans, and now an expanded offering that has come to include underwear, bags, accessories, footwear, fragrances, and cosmetics, Bench has grown into what many might refer to as a one-stop shop.</p>
          <p> The proudly Filipino brand has also become known for enlisting some of the world’s most recognised celebrities as it’s brand ambassadors. This impressive list includes musicians Bruno Mars, Joe Jonas, and Adam Levine, as well as Korean superstars Park Shin Hye and Lee Min Ho. This year, in time for the brand’s 30th anniversary in the retail scene, Bench revealed two of their biggest Global Benchsetters to date – teen idols Brooklyn Beckham and Cole Sprouse.</p>
          <p> Whether it’s creating buzz with the release of a highly anticipated campaign, continually creating products that excite its market, or spearheading initiatives that elevate Filipino talent and craftsmanship to the global stage, Bench continues to raise the benchmark for the Philippines retail landscape. Committed to expanding horizons and pushing boundaries, Bench has never been limited to simple product manufacturing and brand marketing. Instead, the brand remains committed to forming, maintaining, and developing a global lifestyle that is proudly local in its origins.</p>
